- more white space on the landing page ... move the links bar closer to the text and put more white space at top and bottom
- also, don't end the grey color right where the landing page ends ... leave some grey color for like ... 1/6th of a scroll before the white
	- so put some more space between the links and the next content
- more smooth transition animation in opening and closing the descriptions
- scroll covers close 'x'
- since you only use the greyish color once its kind of random so i think it would make it more balanced to add a footer of the same color at the bottom that wraps up all your experience or like thanks for visiting type thing and reiterate ur contact info and links n shit


- linkedin and github links are really close / uneven spacing on the links bar


- smoother closing transition
- try blueish gray color for background?
- 404
